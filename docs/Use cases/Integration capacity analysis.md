[[/Use_cases/Integration_capacity_analysis]] -- Integration capacity analysis

In California, Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs) are required to complete detailed ICA system wide to define the maximum node level hosting capacity to remain within power system criteria. System ICA values are used to expedite interconnection permitting for DER under the Rule 21 interconnection process (Interconnection Use Case). Results must be updated monthly and data must be mapped for review with hourly capacity limitation data available for download by the user. ICA with DER growth scenarios are also required for all annual IOU distribution system planning processes (Planning Use Case). The CPUC provided guidance to IOUs in late 2017 to complete ICA system wide in response to completed IOU demonstration projects and the DER WG final report. 

The current ICA specifications are as follows: 
 - Iterative methodology required
 - ICA results will be updated monthly for changed circuits
 - Employ 576 hourly profiles (monthly min and max day)
 - Localized load shapes to be developed based on AMI
 - ICA results shall be provided in online maps and downloadable datasets for: 
   - Uniform Generation
   - Uniform Load
   - Fixed PV 
   - Operational Flexibility Scenarios: ICA calculated with and without reverse flow constraint at SCADA devices 
 - Mapping displays will include:  Circuit ID; Circuit Load Profile; Section ID; Voltage (kV); Substation ID; Substation Load Profile; System; Customer class proportions on circuit; Existing generation (MW); Queued generation (MW); Total generation (MW); Hosting capacity for uniform generation (MW); Hosting capacity for uniform load(MW); and Hosting capacity for generic PV system (MW). 
 - Publish criteria associated with limiting ICA value
 - Voltage regulating devices are to be allowed to float where software allows 
 - Pre-existing conditions shall limit ICA when adding DER degrades the pre-existing condition, but ICA shall not be limited when adding DER improves pre-existing condition
 - ICA values should be technology agnostic with respect to DER portfolio
 - Node reduction, minimizing the number of nodes analyzed, and limitation category reduction for strong feeders are acceptable methods for computational efficiency

The CPUC is solidifying the role of ICA values in expediting interconnection permitting under Rule 21, further highlighting the need for IOUs to maintain up to date real time ICA values system wide. The CPUC also adopted the ICA use case for distribution planning, further highlighting the need for improved computational efficiency. The commission directs the IOUs to implement DER growth scenarios with ICA to complete annual planning exercises. This requires the evaluation of multiple forecasted scenarios including varying load and network configurations to determine where capacity may become limited and infrastructure may need to be upgraded.
